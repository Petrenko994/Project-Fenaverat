      "Currently active as a software developer residing in Kansas City, Missouri. I graduated cum laude earning a *Bachelor of Science* degree in **Computer Science**. Prior and current work experience includes working with a group of venture capitalists where I designed **algorithms**, **data visualization** and **interface components** suited for large sets of data. I have also had the opportunity of participating in university class group projects, as well as various distinctive independent projects, including the development of this website.",
      "As a developer, I consider myself a life-long learner, constantly pushing my boundaries to enhance my understanding of software development and deployment. I embrace both object-oriented and functional paradigms, and find joy in integrating the expertise I gain into projects showcased in **my projects**."
