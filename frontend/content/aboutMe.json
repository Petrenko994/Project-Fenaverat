      "Currently active as a software developer residing in Kansas City, Missouri. I graduated cum laude earning a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science. Prior and current work experience includes working with a group of venture capitalists where I designed **algorithms**, **visualization** and **interface components** suited for large sets of data. I have had the opportunity of participating in university class group projects, as well as various distinctive independent projects, including the development of this website.",
      "As a developer, I consider myself a life-long learner, so I challenge myself constantly to further build my knowledge base regarding software development and deployment. I'm a fan of both object-oriented and functional paradigms. I enjoy combining the skills learned into projects which are displayed in detail on my GitHub. Please browse the segment MY PROJECTS for more details and examples."
